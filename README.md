### Challenge Description
The Covalent API empowers an army of developers, analysts and 'data nerds' to BUIDL using the richest and most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem. This challenge is to create a basic open source, multi-chain compatible, DEX Analytics Dashboard Template, powered by the Covalent API.

* Pools, swaps, liquidity, volumes
* Lending and borrowing stats
* Trading pair positions, leverage and level of profitability
* Fees
* Yield farmers

### Data presented can include both on-chain and off-chain information.
