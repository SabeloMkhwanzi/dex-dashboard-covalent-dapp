### Lesson learned on this project
* Deep Understanding working with Covalent Api using different endpoints to fetch data.
* Redux has been marked as a complicated tool but in this project, I have gain alot of skills in using Redux new improved tool setup to fetch called REDUX TOOLKIT.
* React-next.js has been my best framework to build React projects in this projects I have gain more skills when it comes page routering. 
* Using Chackra Ui to build thea cool UI - Coolest React UI framework.

### Challenge Description
The Covalent API empowers an army of developers, analysts and 'data nerds' to BUIDL using the richest and most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem. This challenge is to create a basic open source, multi-chain compatible, DEX Analytics Dashboard Template, powered by the Covalent API.

####This template may then be used by any DEX on any (or multiple) Covalent supported blockchains to visualize key analytics around:

* Pools, swaps, liquidity, volumes
* Lending and borrowing stats
* Trading pair positions, leverage and level of profitability
* Fees
* Yield farmers

### Data presented can include both on-chain and off-chain information.

### Some resources which may be useful in putting together this template include:

* https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-frontend
* https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/learn/guides/configure/uniswap-clone
* https://github.com/tradingview/

### Some key features may include visualizations to gauge:

*LP concentration vs decentralization
* DEX sentiment analysis based on tweets and other social media messages
* The overall activity and health metrics of a DEX

### Submission Requirements
* Participants from everywhere can participate in this bounty
* You can submit individually, or as a team. Teams should include no more than four people.
* All of your team participants will need to register here

### What makes a submission complete?
* A presentation (PDF, Slidedeck etc) describing the project
* Link to a video demo (YouTube only) is advisable, but not strictly required
* Your DEX Analytics Dashboard template must be web hosted and publicly accessible
* Your DEX Analytics Dashboard template code repo must be publicly accessible
* The submission must be released under a GPLv3 compatible license

## Judging Criteria
### Submissions will be judged by Covalent based on their technical merits as well as the likelihood of implementation.

In general, submissions are graded on a 1-5 scale in each of the following categories

* Originality: Does the template incorporate something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an existing problem?
* Execution: Is the template usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?
* Usefulness: Is the template practical? Is it something DEX's would actually use?
* Learning: Did the individual or team stretch themselves and push the boundaries of learning in this space?
