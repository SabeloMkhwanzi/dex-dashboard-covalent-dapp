### Lesson learned on this project
* Deep Understanding working with Covalent Api using different endpoints to fetch data.
* Redux has been marked as a complicated tool but in this project, I have gain alot of skills in using Redux new improved tool setup called REDUX TOOLKIT.
* React-next.js has been my best framework to build React projects in this projects I have gain more skills when it comes page routering. 
* Using Chackra Ui to build the cool UI - Coolest React UI framework.

### Challenge Description
The Covalent API empowers an army of developers, analysts and 'data nerds' to BUIDL using the richest and most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem. This challenge is to create a basic open source, multi-chain compatible, DEX Analytics Dashboard Template, powered by the Covalent API.

#### This template may then be used by any DEX on any (or multiple) Covalent supported blockchains to visualize key analytics around:

* Pools, swaps, liquidity, volumes
* Lending and borrowing stats
* Trading pair positions, leverage and level of profitability
* Fees
* Yield farmers

### Data presented can include both on-chain and off-chain information.

### Some resources which may be useful in putting together this template include:

* https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-frontend
* https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/learn/guides/configure/uniswap-clone
* https://github.com/tradingview/

### Some key features may include visualizations to gauge:

*LP concentration vs decentralization
* DEX sentiment analysis based on tweets and other social media messages
* The overall activity and health metrics of a DEX

### Submission Requirements
* Participants from everywhere can participate in this bounty
* You can submit individually, or as a team. Teams should include no more than four people.
