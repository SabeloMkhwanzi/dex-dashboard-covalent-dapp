### Features
 :zap: Fully Responsive\
 :zap: JavaScript\
 :zap: Web application framework - Next JS\
 :zap: Api Fetching Data tool - Redux Toolkit (Change to React-Query)\
 :zap: BackEnd  - Covalent Api\
 :zap: UI Design Tool - Chakra UI      
 :zap: Host\Deployment - Vercel
 

### Lesson learned on this project
* Deep Understanding working with Covalent Api using different endpoints to fetch data.
* Redux has been marked as a complicated tool but in this project, I have gain alot of skills in using Redux new improved tool setup called REDUX TOOLKIT.
* React-next.js has been my best framework to build React projects in this projects I have gain more skills when it comes page routering. 
* Using Chackra Ui to build the cool UI - Coolest React UI framework.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8b0c16d5-5d47-4288-bf7b-5a08a29a8ee0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dexdashdapp/deploys)

### Challenge Description
The Covalent API empowers an army of developers, analysts and 'data nerds' to BUIDL using the richest and most robust data infrastructure for the entire blockchain ecosystem. This challenge is to create a basic open source, multi-chain compatible, DEX Analytics Dashboard Template, powered by the Covalent API.

#### This template may then be used by any DEX on any (or multiple) Covalent supported blockchains to visualize key analytics around:

* Pools, swaps, liquidity, volumes
* Lending and borrowing stats
* Trading pair positions, leverage and level of profitability
* Fees
* Yield farmers

### Data presented can include both on-chain and off-chain information.

### Some resources which may be useful in putting together this template include:

* https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-frontend
* https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/learn/guides/configure/uniswap-clone
* https://github.com/tradingview/

### Some key features may include visualizations to gauge:

*LP concentration vs decentralization
* DEX sentiment analysis based on tweets and other social media messages
* The overall activity and health metrics of a DEX

### Submission Requirements
* Participants from everywhere can participate in this bounty
* You can submit individually, or as a team. Teams should include no more than four people.
* All of your team participants will need to register here

### What makes a submission complete?
* A presentation (PDF, Slidedeck etc) describing the project
* Link to a video demo (YouTube only) is advisable, but not strictly required
* Your DEX Analytics Dashboard template must be web hosted and publicly accessible
* Your DEX Analytics Dashboard template code repo must be publicly accessible
* The submission must be released under a GPLv3 compatible license

## Installing

1. clone the repo with the following git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SabeloMkhwanzi/eddalytics
```

2. open a terminal in the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the package dependencies for the project

Create a .env.local file in the root folder and populate it with the following variables, Get Api a key from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/)

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_COVALENT_APIKEY=
```


Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Happy Hacking 😊
